# Self-Mode: Individual Navigation


In Self-Mode, you are the Absolute Monarch of your local data environment. 


### Interface Integration:
1.  **Launch GAP Widget**: Open your local instance.
2.  **Media Picker**: Use the integration tool to select your own sequences (e.g., 6-digit hex codes).
3.  **Observation**: Relate your data sequences with the visual feedback of the FBC.
