# SI: Sub-phase Instruction (The Pilot's Manual)

Status: **Conceptual / Draft**
Application: **Phase 2 Customization**

The Sub-phase Instruction (SI) is where the user transitions from a passenger to a pilot. While the system provides **Default Algorithms** (6-digit sequences for free/non-commercial use), the SI allows you to define *how* you interact with them.

### 🧠 Food for Thought for Future Adepts:
1. **Level 1AI-2AI:** How will you structure your Excel interface to minimize "Digital Fuel" friction?
2. **Level 3AI:** If your interface (e.g., the Pen) becomes your primary tool, how do you document its movements in the 18-digit protocol?
3. **Level 4AI-5AI:** When Time and Ethics are added to the gearbox, does your "Green Button" status depend on speed or on the precision of your intent?

### 🛡️ Safety Warning:
The SI is your protection against the **Red Buttock**. A well-drafted SI ensures that even in "Deep Water," your landing remains a **Green Button** event.
