# Terms & Conditions (T&C)
## AUTARTOS S.A. | Bionanosatellite Navigation Simulator (BNS)

### 1. AUTHORSHIP AND OWNERSHIP
The AUTARTOS S.A. ecosystem, including the GAP Widget, the BNS Simulator, and all associated methodologies, is the intellectual property of **Waldemar Jablonski**. 
* **Legal Status:** The Author is a Polish citizen and a UK resident, operating as a Sole Trader under the trade name IPTIM Solutions. This entity operates in full compliance with UK law as a non-incorporated business (non-Ltd), and as such, is not required to be listed in the Companies House register of limited companies.

### 2. STRATEGIC RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS
This Research & Development (R&D) environment is developed in strategic cooperation with the following global partners:
* **Nano Satellite Yard (NSY) LLC (Egypt):** Led by **Professor Ahmad Anwar** of the **University of Alexandria**. NSY LLC provides the academic and technical framework for bionanosatellite testing and validation.
* **EchoSphere Ltd (UK):** A partner in the implementation of resonant communication protocols and operational deployment.
* **Status of Cooperation:** These partnerships are governed by **Letters of Intent (LoI)** and mutual R&D agreements, establishing a unique global development potential for the AUTARTOS startup.

### 3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & PROTOCOLS
* **Floating Copyright (FC ©️):** All content, logic, and navigational structures are protected under the Floating Copyright system, notarized in Poland.
* **Transmission Protocols:** Operations are strictly governed by **TPC** (Transmission Protocols for Communication) and **TPO** (Transmission Protocols for Operations).
* **Geometric Logic:** The system utilizes the **Transformer of Multidimensionality (TM/ToM)** and the concept of the **Regular Infinitesimal Solid (The Sphere)** as an extension of Platonic geometry.

### 4. R&D TESTING & USAGE RULES
* **Purpose:** The BNS Simulator is provided for research, training, and simulation purposes only.
* **The Alcove Security:** Navigators (Students/Partners) are required to maintain the physical stability of the Bionanosatellite within their designated workspace (The Alcove). 
* **FBC Authority:** Navigation beyond the physical workspace is authorized strictly via the **Freed Bionanosatellite Cursor (FBC)**.
* **Data Sovereignty:** While IPTIM Solutions owns the core architecture, users retain sovereignty over their personal bionavigational data generated during sessions.

### 5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
The AUTARTOS S.A. environment is provided "as is" during its R&D phase. Neither the Author nor the Partners (NSY LLC, EchoSphere Ltd) shall be held liable for "Divergence Errors" or loss of communication resulting from improper 6-digit sequence calibration or breach of Alcove protocols.

### 6. System Integration and Jurisdictional Framework

6.1. These Terms & Conditions (T&C) are strictly integrated with the `DISCLAIMER.md` file located in the root directory. Users are required to read both documents concurrently.

6.2. The AUTARTOS methodology, including the Transformer of Multidimensionality (TM/ToM) and the 18-digit TPC/TPO certification standard, operates under the "Serious Joke Specialist" protocol for external communication.

6.3. Any interaction within the ART environment that transition from Self-mode to Co-op mode requires a valid session token and adherence to the L1-L6 responsibility levels.

6.4. In case of any conflict between these T&C and the specific project READMEs, the definitions provided in the [DISCLAIMER.md] shall prevail as the primary source of operational logic.
