# IF2: Phase 2 – Deep Water Operations (RTM)

Status: **Active Session (Default 5:00)**
Objective: Maintaining GB Status through the Sub-phase Instruction (IS).

### 1. Sub-phase Instruction (IS)
The IS is your "personal steering" within the default 5-minute window.
* **Self-Mode:** You define the parameters in Excel.
* **Operational Gear:**
    * **Low Gears (1-3AI):** Data integrity and interface calibration.
    * **High Gears (4-5AI):** Swarm patterns, ToM/TM, and DPPP integration.

### 2. The Referee (AI Interpreter)
Failure to adhere to the TPC/TPO/FC protocols results in a **Red Buttock (RB)**—a "red card" leading to a downward candle in the AUTARTOS Index.
