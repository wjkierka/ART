# Quick Start Guide: BNS Simulator

Welcome to the AUTARTOS R&D environment. To ensure a successful start, follow these three steps:

1. **Environmental Calibration:** Ensure your session takes place in a stable "Alcove" (designated studio/workspace).
2. **Interface Selection:** Identify your personal 3D Divergence Point (your primary tool/interface).
3. **GAP Activation:** Use the Green Button to initiate a Self-Mode session. Record your 6-digit sequence for future Co-op sessions with the Lead Controller.
