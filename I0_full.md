# I0: Zero Instruction - AIDIS Arsenal Management

Welcome to the heart of **S.A. (Spójnia Akacjowa / Acacia Union) ART 3AI**. This is the space where "you know what you know, and you know what you don't know."

### 1. System Components
This instruction defines the Auto-Detection Status (ASA) for the following components:
* **GAP Widget:** Entry gate and identity scanner.
* **Dashboard (BNS):** Navigation simulator and Index visualization.
* **Excel:** Code repository and Sub-phase Instruction (IS) database.
* **TPC/TPO/FC:** Protocols protecting your sovereignty (Transmission Protocols for Communication / Operations / Floating Copyright).

### 2. Auto-Detection Procedure (Phase 0)
Before entering the first digit of the Phase 1 code, the system verifies:
* **Digital Fuel:** The distance to the oldest code in your reserve.
* **Identity Lock:** The camera feed is embedded in the Ticker location (Green Button). You are the Host.
* **Archive Status:** Continuity of the 18-digit records in Excel.

### 3. Path to Phase 1
Successful identification unlocks the "Alkowy" (Alcoves) and allows review of **Phase 1 Instruction (IF1)**. Remember: the moment you enter the 6th digit of the code, you enter the "Deep Water" of Phase 2.

*It is highly recommended to study the Fibonacci Golden Egg technique before starting.*
