# AUTARTOS Navigation Tutorial


Welcome to the gateway of the Acacia Union (S.A. - Spójnia Akacjowa). 
Navigation in the M80 area requires selecting the appropriate operational mode.


### 1. Select Your Operational Mode
Choose the protocol corresponding to your current session status:


* **[SELF MODE]** – Independent navigation and private calibration. Use this if you are exploring the GAP Widget potential on your own.
    > [Proceed to Self-Mode Guide](TUTORIAL_SELF.md)


* **[CO-OP / B2B MODE]** – Synchronized session with a Host. This path is for active R&D tests (e.g., GAP R&D Forum).
    > [Connect to Active Session Protocol](SESSION_ACTIVE.md)

### 2. Technical Preparation
Before starting, ensure your local environment is ready for the **Freed Bionanosatellite Cursor (FBC)**. 

*Prepare your data sequences (e.g., .xlsx or .csv) for the Media Picker integration.*
