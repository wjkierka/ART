# AUTARTOS S.A. | Bionanosatellite Navigation Simulator (BNS)
## Technical Documentation & Operating Protocols (ART 3AI)

### 1. LEGAL IDENTITY & COPYRIGHT
* **Organization:** AUTARTOS S.A. (Polish: Spójnia Akacjowa / English: Acacia Union).
* **Protocols:** Operated under **TPC** (Transmission Protocols for Communication) and **TPO** (Transmission Protocols for Operations).
* **Intellectual Property:** All rights reserved under **FC** (Floating Copyright ©️).
* **Status:** This is a non-commercial R&D environment for multidimensional navigation.

### 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (AIDIS & TM)
The BNS Simulator utilizes the **Transformer of Multidimensionality (TM/ToM)** to scale data processing:
* **ART 3AI:** Standard Spacetime interface (The Alcove).
* **ART 4AI:** Navigation through the "Graph of Ignorance" towards scaled AI assistance.
* **ART 5AI - 6AI:** Theoretical expansion using polynomial scaling ($n = 0 \dots 6$).

#### Geometric Power Processing:
Computational logic is based on **Platonic Solids** for clear controller geometry, expanded by the:
* **Regular Infinitesimal Solid (The Sphere):** Introduced by AUTARTOS to bridge classical geometry with universal mind navigation.



### 3. OPERATIONAL MODES
| Mode | Interface | Protocol |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Self-Mode** | GAP Widget | 6-Digit Sequence Calibration |
| **Co-op Mode** | GAP Widget | B2B / Collaborative Session |
| **Navigation** | FBC Cursor | Remote Deep Space (M80) Exploration |

### 4. BIONANOSATELLITE SECURITY PROTOCOLS (IMPORTANT)
* **Local Stability:** The Bionanosatellite MUST remain within the physical boundaries of the **Alcove** (Studio/Home).
* **Proportion:** The spatial ratio of the human body to the Bionanosatellite is strictly maintained within the physical reach of the navigator.
* **FBC Deployment:** Only the **Floating Bionanosatellite Cursor (FBC)** is authorized to travel beyond the workspace to explore M80 and universal consciousness. This prevents communication loss and ensures the safety of the human-bio-satellite bond.

### 5. TERMS & CONDITIONS (T&C's)
1. Usage of the BNS Simulator requires an active GAP Widget session.
2. Users are responsible for their own "Interests of Divergence" (e.g., musical instruments or other 3D interfaces).
3. Data verification is the responsibility of the navigator (The Verifier).
