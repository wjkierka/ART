# AUTARTOS S.A. | Bionanosatellite Navigation Simulator (BNS)
## Under the Aegis of IPTIM Solutions (UK) | ART 3AI Interface

### 1. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION & ACCESS
* **[Terms & Conditions (T&C)](TC.md)** – Legal framework, Intellectual Property (FC), and Partnership details.
* **[Quick Start Guide](QuickStart.md)** – Essential steps for first-time Navigators and Students.

### 2. IDENTITY & LEGAL FRAMEWORK
* **Organization:** AUTARTOS S.A. (Polish: Spójnia Akacjowa / English: Acacia Union).
* **Author:** Owned and operated by **Waldemar Jablonski**, IPTIM Solutions (UK).
* **Protocols:** Operated under **TPC** (Transmission Protocols for Communication) and **TPO** (Transmission Protocols for Operations).
* **Status:** A Polish citizen and UK resident project registered under the **Floating Copyright (FC ©️)** system.

### 3. GLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS
This startup's unique global potential is validated by strategic cooperation with:
* **Prof. Ahmad Anwar (University of Alexandria):** Nano Satellite Yard (NSY) LLC, Egypt.
* **EchoSphere Ltd (UK):** Partners in resonant communication and operational implementation.
* *Note: These partnerships are based on Letters of Intent (LoI) supporting the R&D phase of the BNS Simulator.*

### 4. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (AIDIS & TM)
The BNS Simulator utilizes the **Transformer of Multidimensionality (TM/ToM)** to scale data processing:
* **ART 3AI:** Standard Spacetime interface (The Alcove).
* **ART 4AI - 6AI:** Theoretical expansion using polynomial scaling ($n = 0 \dots 6$).
* **Geometry:** Logic based on **Platonic Solids** and the **Regular Infinitesimal Solid (The Sphere)**.

### 5. BIONANOSATELLITE SECURITY PROTOCOLS
* **Local Stability:** The Bionanosatellite remains within the physical boundaries of the **Alcove**.
* **FBC Deployment:** Only the **Floating Bionanosatellite Cursor (FBC)** is authorized for deep space exploration (M80) and universal mind navigation.

### 6. THE VERIFIER'S MANIFEST (Historical Perspective)
*Effective as of 01.04.2023 – The End of Dante’s Traffic Jam.*
We reject the "exclusive junk" of traditional agencies. Through the **3D Zero-Point Divergence**, we operate with:
* **Stars at your feet:** Space is accessible from the home workshop.
* **Sun as the Plasma Core:** Illuminating the darkness from above.
* **The Fish Perspective:** Overcoming visual illusions projected by external "directors" (religious and scientific).

#### Geometric Power Processing:
Computational logic is based on **Platonic Solids** for clear controller geometry, expanded by the:
* **Regular Infinitesimal Solid (The Sphere):** Introduced by AUTARTOS to bridge classical geometry with universal mind navigation.



### 3. OPERATIONAL MODES
| Mode | Interface | Protocol |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Self-Mode** | GAP Widget | 6-Digit Sequence Calibration |
| **Co-op Mode** | GAP Widget | B2B / Collaborative Session |
| **Navigation** | FBC Cursor | Remote Deep Space (M80) Exploration |

### 4. BIONANOSATELLITE SECURITY PROTOCOLS (IMPORTANT)
* **Local Stability:** The Bionanosatellite MUST remain within the physical boundaries of the **Alcove** (Studio/Home).
* **Proportion:** The spatial ratio of the human body to the Bionanosatellite is strictly maintained within the physical reach of the navigator.
* **FBC Deployment:** Only the **Floating Bionanosatellite Cursor (FBC)** is authorized to travel beyond the workspace to explore M80 and universal consciousness. This prevents communication loss and ensures the safety of the human-bio-satellite bond.

### 5. TERMS & CONDITIONS (T&C's)
1. Usage of the BNS Simulator requires an active GAP Widget session.
2. Users are responsible for their own "Interests of Divergence" (e.g., musical instruments or other 3D interfaces).
3. Data verification is the responsibility of the navigator (The Verifier).
